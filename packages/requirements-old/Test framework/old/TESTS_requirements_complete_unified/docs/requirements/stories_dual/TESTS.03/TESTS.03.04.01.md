# TESTS.03.04.01 – Visualize test flakiness trends over time

---

## 🧑‍💻 Human Format (Product Intent)

**As** a QA lead,  
**I want** chart test pass/fail rates and failure frequencies,  
**So that** I can detect flaky tests early and prioritize stability fixes.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Entities covered:
- Test history DB
- Charting library
- Failure timestamps
- AC is verified by automated test runs in CI
- Any regression causes a visible failure with actionable logs

---

## 🤖 AI Format (Execution Structure)

**Objective:**  
Implement support for these entities:
- Test history DB
- Charting library
- Failure timestamps

**Requirements:**
- Ensure modular and reusable implementation
- Align input/output with agent and human-facing formats
- Integrate with CI and dev workflows
- Provide logs or errors in structured output

**Validation:**
- AI agents can read and validate structure
- Engineers confirm story via tests and CLI tools

## 📋 Tasks

- [ ] Pull test run history from CI logs or test DB
- [ ] Aggregate and chart pass/fail ratios over time
- [ ] Highlight any tests with >15% intermittent failures
- [ ] Export charts to PNG and embed in weekly QA report
