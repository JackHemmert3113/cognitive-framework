# 🧠 Session Summary – Adaptive AI-Powered Tests Framework

This session covered the full specification and documentation of an AI-first, multi-epic testing strategy.

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 1. Epic Architecture
- Defined `TESTS.02` to `TESTS.05` with Epics → Features → Stories → Tasks → Acceptance Criteria
- Each epic has its own index and shared access to vision/business value anchors

### 2. Zip Packaging & Repo Structure
- All files stored under `docs/requirements/` by type
- Shared README, epic indexes, and modular markdown structure
- Final ZIP: `TESTS_requirements_all.zip`

### 3. Vision & Business Value
- Vision: AI agents that evolve testing through validation, repair, and scenario introspection
- Value: Reduce fragility, speed debugging, shift testing from reactive to intelligent

### 4. Agent Compatibility
- Linked markdown structure allows full traversal from vision → task
- AI agents (Junie, Copilot, OpenAI) can query or act from any layer

### 5. Installer Script
- Double-click `.command` moves files into place and optionally deletes ZIP
- Simplifies team onboarding and repo bootstrapping

### 6. Planning Next
- Optional future epics: Mobile CI Lab, Compliance Verification, Human-in-the-Loop QA
- Possible extensions: Notion/GitHub syncing, visual roadmap dashboards

### 9. 🔄 Consolidate Acceptance Criteria Into Each Story

We are no longer storing acceptance criteria in a separate `acceptance-criteria/` folder.

**Why this changed:**
- AC defines “done” for a story—so it belongs *in the story*
- Keeping it together improves clarity for AI agents, engineers, and reviewers
- Prevents drift between story definition and validation

**Updated Format:**
Each story file now contains:
- `## 🧑‍💻 Human Format`
- `## 🤖 AI Format`
- `### ✅ Acceptance Criteria` (inside the human section)

**Benefit:** More portable, reviewable, and executable by agents and humans alike.

### 🔁 10. Unified Story Structure (All Future Stories)

We’ve adopted a universal format for all stories across all epics:

#### Story Format:
- `## 🧑‍💻 Human Format` — Context, persona, value
- `### ✅ Acceptance Criteria` — What defines “done” (lives under Human Format)
- `## 🤖 AI Format` — Explicit implementation guide for agents
- `## 📋 Tasks` — Concrete developer steps (1–2 point chunks)

**Why this matters:**
- Keeps story, scope, validation, and execution in a single file
- Prevents drift between story content and test coverage
- AI agents and human engineers both get what they need with no context switching

### 📐 11. Epic and Feature Alignment

Epics and features follow the same **narrative clarity → execution scope** model:

#### Epic format:
- Vision-level summary
- High-level business outcomes
- Primary pain points addressed
- Related features

#### Feature format:
- Clear capability definition (e.g. “Offline fallback for workouts”)
- Not tied to UI screens
- References relevant stories by ID

**No separate AC or task files** for epics/features—those live in stories.

This ensures stories remain the atomic unit of work while epics/features organize intent.
