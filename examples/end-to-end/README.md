# Cognitive Framework - End-to-End Example

MIT License

This example shows how the requirements framework works together with the dual mode and AI test packages.

1. A requirement is processed using `cogreq` which generates `.ai` context files.
2. The AI test framework runs on the project and returns results.

Run the example:

```bash
npm install
node examples/end-to-end
```
