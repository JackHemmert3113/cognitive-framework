# Cognitive Framework Product Requirements Document

This document captures the high-level vision and implementation roadmap for the Cognitive Framework. It draws from existing repository documentation and the high-level implementation plan outlined by the product owner.

## Purpose
The Cognitive Framework aims to provide modular tooling so that human developers and AI agents can collaborate seamlessly. It supports both IDE-driven workflows and fully automated AI-driven modes, enabling flexible development and testing strategies.

## Vision
Create an agent-first ecosystem where AI and humans work together through a common set of tools. Agents perform tasks autonomously, while humans guide priorities and review the results. Natural language acts as the primary interface, letting contributors express intent without memorizing strict syntax. As AI capabilities evolve, the framework should improve without major rewrites.

## Core Platform Epics and Features

### Epic A: Agent-Core & AI Integration
- **A1 – Agent orchestration:** foundational layer for spawning and managing agents, including task queues and sandboxed execution.
- **A2 – AI provider abstraction:** pluggable interface for integrating different LLM or AI services.
- **A3 – Context handling:** standardized way to feed data and prompts into agents using the requirements module's context generation.

### Epic B: Dual-Mode Development
- **B1 – IDE extensions:** plugins that surface agent capabilities in VS Code or a web IDE.
- **B2 – CLI/API bridge:** command line tools that mirror the IDE features for automation.
- **B3 – Context synchronization:** shared location for context files and artifacts across modes.

### Epic C: AI Test Framework
- **C1 – Phase-based execution and logging:** discrete phases with rich logs for agent analysis.
- **C2 – Self-healing and diagnostics:** AI-driven failure triage and automatic remediation.
- **C3 – Visual regression and environment isolation:** visual diffs and cross-browser/device support.

### Epic D: Developer Experience & Observability
- **D1 – Interactive reports:** HTML dashboards with trends and coverage metrics.
- **D2 – Notification channel integration:** Slack/email/voice summaries with deep links to the IDE or CLI.
- **D3 – Historical insights:** track flaky tests, performance data, and AI recommendations.

### Epic E: Mobile, Accessibility, & UX Resilience
- **E1 – Accessibility audits:** automatic a11y checks with AI-suggested fixes.
- **E2 – Responsive and offline testing:** touch flow validators and edge-mode support.
- **E3 – Embedded SDK/plugin harness:** allow teams to integrate custom UI components for testing.

## Implementation Phases
1. **Foundational Modules (Epics A & B):** establish agent orchestration, AI integrations, and dual-mode support.
2. **AI Test Framework (Epic C):** implement core testing capabilities with self-healing and logging.
3. **Developer Experience & Observability (Epic D):** provide reporting, notifications, and dashboards once tests generate data.
4. **Expansion to Mobile & Accessibility (Epic E):** extend tooling for mobile platforms and deeper UX checks.
5. **Continuous Feedback & Evolution:** iterate on agent behavior, requirements parsing, and test strategies as real-world usage grows.
