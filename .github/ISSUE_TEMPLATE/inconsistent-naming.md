# Inconsistent Project Naming: "Cognitive Framework" vs "Forge Framework"

## Description
There is inconsistent naming throughout the repository. The project appears to be transitioning from "Cognitive Framework" to "Forge Framework", but this change hasn't been fully implemented across all documentation and code.

## Evidence
- The repository directory is named "forge-framework"
- The newer component "forge-agent" uses the "@forge/agent" package name and references "@forge/framework"
- However, the main package.json, README.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md still refer to the project as "Cognitive Framework"
- All GitHub links in the main documentation point to "cognitive-framework" (e.g., https://github.com/JackHemmert3113/cognitive-framework)

## Impact
This inconsistency can cause confusion for contributors and users of the framework. It also makes it difficult to understand the relationship between different components of the project.

## Suggested Solution
Standardize the naming across all documentation and code:
1. Update all references to "Cognitive Framework" to "Forge Framework" in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and other documentation
2. Update the package name in the root package.json from "cognitive-framework" to "forge-framework"
3. Update all GitHub links to reflect the correct repository name
4. Ensure all components use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "@forge/...")

## Additional Notes
If there's a specific reason for maintaining both names, please document this clearly to avoid confusion.
