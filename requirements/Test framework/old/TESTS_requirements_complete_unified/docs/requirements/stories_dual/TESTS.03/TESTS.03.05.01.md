# TESTS.03.05.01 – Implement CLI to run targeted tests

---

## 🧑‍💻 Human Format (Product Intent)

**As** a developer,  
**I want** run individual test scenarios from the terminal,  
**So that** I can debug a specific test locally without running the full suite.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Entities covered:
- Test scenario ID
- CLI runner
- Logs
- AC is verified by automated test runs in CI
- Any regression causes a visible failure with actionable logs

## 🤖 AI Format (Execution Structure)

**Objective:**  
Implement support for these entities:
- Test scenario ID
- CLI runner
- Logs

**Requirements:**
- Ensure modular and reusable implementation
- Align input/output with agent and human-facing formats
- Integrate with CI and dev workflows
- Provide logs or errors in structured output

**Validation:**
- AI agents can read and validate structure
- Engineers confirm story via tests and CLI tools
