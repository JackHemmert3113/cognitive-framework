# TESTS.03.03.01 – Enable AI-assisted failure root cause analysis

---

## 🧑‍💻 Human Format (Product Intent)

**As** a test automation engineer,  
**I want** run failure postmortems using AI analysis tools,  
**So that** I can get quick insight into why tests failed and reduce debug time.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Entities covered:
- Test result logs
- Stack traces
- System metrics
- AC is verified by automated test runs in CI
- Any regression causes a visible failure with actionable logs

---

## 🤖 AI Format (Execution Structure)

**Objective:**  
Implement support for these entities:
- Test result logs
- Stack traces
- System metrics

**Requirements:**
- Ensure modular and reusable implementation
- Align input/output with agent and human-facing formats
- Integrate with CI and dev workflows
- Provide logs or errors in structured output

**Validation:**
- AI agents can read and validate structure
- Engineers confirm story via tests and CLI tools

## 📋 Tasks

- [ ] Capture full output from test runs and save to failure logs
- [ ] Use LLM prompt to extract root cause based on stack trace
- [ ] Summarize root cause in markdown for human consumption
- [ ] Attach root cause summary to GitHub PR or test dashboard
