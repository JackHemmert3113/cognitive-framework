# ðŸ§  Session Summary â€“ Adaptive AI-Powered Tests Framework

This session covered the full specification and documentation of an AI-first, multi-epic testing strategy.

## âœ… Topics Covered

### 1. Epic Architecture
- Defined `TESTS.02` to `TESTS.05` with Epics â†’ Features â†’ Stories â†’ Tasks â†’ Acceptance Criteria
- Each epic has its own index and shared access to vision/business value anchors

### 2. Zip Packaging & Repo Structure
- All files stored under `docs/requirements/` by type
- Shared README, epic indexes, and modular markdown structure
- Final ZIP: `TESTS_requirements_all.zip`

### 3. Vision & Business Value
- Vision: AI agents that evolve testing through validation, repair, and scenario introspection
- Value: Reduce fragility, speed debugging, shift testing from reactive to intelligent

### 4. Agent Compatibility
- Linked markdown structure allows full traversal from vision â†’ task
- AI agents (Junie, Copilot, OpenAI) can query or act from any layer

### 5. Installer Script
- Double-click `.command` moves files into place and optionally deletes ZIP
- Simplifies team onboarding and repo bootstrapping

### 6. Planning Next
- Optional future epics: Mobile CI Lab, Compliance Verification, Human-in-the-Loop QA
- Possible extensions: Notion/GitHub syncing, visual roadmap dashboards
